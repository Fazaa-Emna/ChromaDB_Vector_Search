# üìù Text Embedding and Semantic Search with ChromaDB

Welcome to the **Text Embedding and Semantic Search with ChromaDB** project! This repository demonstrates how to process textual data by chunking it with overlap, generating embeddings using the `SentenceTransformer` model, storing them in ChromaDB, and performing vector searches. This approach ensures efficient semantic search capabilities for your text data.


## üåü Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive solution for managing and searching textual data based on semantic similarity. By leveraging the power of `SentenceTransformer` for embedding generation and ChromaDB for storage and retrieval, you can efficiently perform semantic searches on your text data.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Text Chunking with Overlap:** Splits large texts into overlapping chunks to preserve context.
- **Embedding Generation:** Converts text chunks into embeddings using `SentenceTransformer`.
- **Data Ingestion:** Processes text data and stores embeddings in ChromaDB.
- **Vector Search:** Retrieves documents similar to a query based on semantic similarity.
